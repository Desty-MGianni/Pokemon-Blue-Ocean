# Hello everyone!
## Here's my first project: Pokémon Blue Ocean
It is of course a CLI copy of the 3rd gen Pokémon Green Leaf and Red Flames.
I used beaupy for all the interactions in the game to ensure a user-friendly experience.

I know I lack a lot of knowledge as it's my first experience with coding so if you have feedbacks I will gladly read and learn!
