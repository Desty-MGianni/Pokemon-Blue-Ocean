This project is made as an portfolio project in the Computer Science curriculum in [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/computer-science).

I know I lack a lot of knowledge as it's my first experience with coding so if you have feedbacks I will gladly read and learn!

## How to run the code:

1. With terminal go to the directory where is located your `main.py` file.
2. Type `source env/bin/activate`, it launch the vitual environment so that you don't need to install anything.
3. Type `python main.py` to launch the game.

## External module used to make this program:

- [Beaupy](https://pypi.org/project/beaupy/)

## Upgrades To Do in the future:

- Use an GUI (tkinter or pygame)
- Implement database save/load system
- Create a .app / .exe for user ease of use
